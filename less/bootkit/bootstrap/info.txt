This folder contains some Bootstrap overrides which you might or might not want to use.
Review them individually just to be sure nothing is colliding with your own Bootstrap style rules.

Some classes use the LESS prefix (by default bk-) but not all. Progress bars and carousels are the only
files that actually create new, usable BootKit variables.
